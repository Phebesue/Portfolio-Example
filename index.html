                <h2>Summer J Kerekes</h2>
        <h3> Hi! My name is Summer Kerekes. I am a US Army veteran trained in using, maintaining and training users of Army communications equipment. I have 20 years experience making people's lives easier as an Executive Assistant. In 2017, I changed directions. I moved into IT as an associate programmer and co-managed an Enterprise level Skype for Business hybrid (Unified Communications) platform for 19,000+ users. In 2018, my company was purchased and in early 2019, I was laid off. I am interested in Eleven-Fifty's web development bootcamp to up my skillset! I've taken two of their intro to coding for HTML & CSS courses and am excited to learn more! </h3>
